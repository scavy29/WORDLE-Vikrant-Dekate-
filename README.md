I have included both Command Line Based Application as well as a Frontend Based application
<html>
<head>
<p>Just install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/"  target="_blank">termcolor</a> module which is an ANSI Color Formatting module which we use here to determine wrong, right letters</p>

CMD Files:-
1] main.py
2] words.txt
CMD based is working properly

<h2>Preview</h2>


Frontend:-
Tried to make the frontend only with few references without any functionality. So tried my best to make the frontend only.

I Hope you Like My Work
Thank you
